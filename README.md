#A general program to perform simultaneous maximum likelihood fittings of the decay curves with gates on neutron. The decay curves can be given as a form of unbin or bin data.

### To run benchmark:

```bash
cd build-pgenfit
./runbenchmark.sh
```

ignore errors

comparing with mlhfitv1

```bash
cd pgenfit/dev/mlhfitv1
./runbenchmark.sh
```
